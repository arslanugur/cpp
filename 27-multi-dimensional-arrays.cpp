Multi-Dimensional Arrays
      //A multi-dimensional array holds one or more arrays. Declare a multidimensional array as follows.
type name[size1][size2]...[sizeN];

      //Here, we've created a two-dimensional 3x4 integer array:
int x[3][4];

      //Visualize this array as a table composed of 3 rows, and 4 columns.
/*     	|  Coloumn 1 | Coloumn 2 | Coloumn 3 | Coloumn 4 |
Row 1   |  x[0]0[]   |  x[0][1]  |  x[0][2]  |  x[0][3]  |
Row 2   |  x[1][0]   |  x[1][1]  |  x[1][2]  |  x[1][3]  |
Row 3   |  x[2][0]   |  x[2][1]  |  x[2][2]  |  x[2][3]  |*/

      //Remember element counting always starts from 0.
