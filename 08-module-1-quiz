      //Example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
 cout << "c plus plus" << endl;

return 0;
}

      //Example
int x = 4;
int y = 7;
int sum = x + y;

cout << "sum equals to " << sum << endl;

      //there must be a function named main
      //each variable must have its data type
      
      //Example
int x = 81;
int y = 3;

cout << x / y << endl;

      //Example
int a=3;
int b=2;
b=a++;
cout<<++b;    //output: 4

/*
ignore the b = 2 statement, the next line, b = a++, changes b's value to 3, 
and the ++ does not apply here yet, as it only adds to the variable when it is finished running the line using cout. 
right now it is just a variable, so it stays at 3. cout << ++b; makes it 3+1, which is 4. it is NOT 5. 
the a++ applies to the intiger after the code is finished running, however the ++b does apply, 
because the +1 is added during the execution. 
code that equals 5: int a = 3; int b = ++a; (again, ignore the b = 2) cout << ++b; 
code that equals 4: int a = 3; int b = a++; cout << ++b;*/
